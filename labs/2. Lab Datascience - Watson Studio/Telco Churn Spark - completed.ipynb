    "The analytics use case implemented in this notebook is telco churn. While it's a simple use case, it implements all steps from the CRISP-DM methodolody, which is the recommended best practice for implementing predictive analytics. \n",
    "![CRISP-DM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yfphoon/dsx_demo/master/crisp_dm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The analytics process starts with defining the business problem and identifying the data that can be used to solve the problem. For Telco churn, we use demographic and historical transaction data. We also know which customers have churned, which is the critical information for building predictive models. In the next step, we use visual APIs for data understanding and complete some data preparation tasks. In a typical analytics project data preparation will include more steps (for example, formatting data or deriving new variables). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is ready, we can build a predictive model. In our example we are using the SparkML Random Forrest classification model. Classification is a statistical technique which assigns a \"class\" to each customer record (for our use case \"churn\" or \"no churn\"). Classification models use historical data to come up with the logic to predict \"class\", this process is called model training. After the model is created, it's usually evaluated using another data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if the model's accuracy meets the expectations, it can be deployed for scoring. Scoring is the process of applying the model to a new set of data. For example, when we receive new transactional data, we can score the customer for the risk of churn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also developed a sample Python Flask application to illustrate deployment: http://predictcustomerchurn.mybluemix.net/. This application implements the REST client call to the model."
